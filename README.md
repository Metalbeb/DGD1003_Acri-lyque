GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT

1. Overview
- Game Title: Acri-lyque
- Genre: Puzzle platformer
- Target Audience: 8-13 age group, people who like to think outside the box
- Summary: Puzzle platformer where you can control the attributes of the objects to get through the levels. Everything is devoid of color and by painting certain platforms you can make them move.
- Key features: Limited paint bar, being able to control the movement of objects to get across or block damage

 2. Game Mechanics
- Core Gameplay: By default, objects are stationary. By painting certain objects you can make them move or have different attributes (this will allow you to get across the levels), depending of the color of your paint. But watch out, because you have a limited amount of paint and you will need to conserve your paint and decide what to paint.
- Controls: The A and D keys will move left and right respectively, and spacebar is jump. You aim your brush (and by definition what to paint) with the mouse.
- Characters: You are Acri-lyque, a multidimensional guardian of color destined to prevent the sentient calamity known as the Bleach from draining the multiverse of its color. The Bleach is the only other "character" present in the game. Its an intelligent and malevolent entity that resurrects every couple eons, only to be defeated and seealed by a race called Esprit (Acri's people) everytime it reawakens.
- Objects: Boxes, elevators, see-saws and floating platforms that are in greyscale and fully frozen (not literally, they just don't move), but can be painted to have different effects depending on the color of the paint
- Progression System: Reaching the end of the level goal will put you in the next level
- Difficulty Level: Not too hard, not too easy. Each level is more challenging than the previous.
