GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT

1. Overview
- Game Title: Acri'lyque
- Genre: Puzzle platformer
- Target Audience: 8-13 age group, people who like to think outside the box
- Summary: Puzzle platformer where you can control the attributes of the objects to get through the levels. Everything is devoid of color and by painting certain platforms you can make them move.
- Key features: Limited paint bar, being able to control the movement and abilities of objects to get across obstacles or block incoming damage

 2. Game Mechanics
- Core Gameplay: By default, objects are stationary. By painting certain objects you can make them move or have different attributes (this will allow you to get across the levels), depending of the color of your paint. But watch out, because you have a limited amount of paint and you will need to conserve your paint and decide what to paint.
- Controls: The A and D keys will move left and right respectively, and spacebar is jump. You aim your brush (and by definition what to paint) with the mouse.
- Characters: Acri can move left or right, jump and aim Pinceau Chromatique, (her paintbrush), which makes her quite simple to learn. The Bleach is the main antagonist and will be seen only at the end.
- Objects: Boxes, elevators, see-saws and floating platforms that are in greyscale and fully frozen (not literally, they just don't move), but can be painted to have different effects depending on the color of the paint
- Progression System: Reaching the end of the level goal will put you in the next level
- Difficulty Level: Not too hard, not too easy. Each level is more challenging than the previous.

3. Story And World
-Story Summary: Every couple billion years, the formless and shapeless terrible eldritch being known as the Bleach reawakens/resurrects and sets out to feed on the color of anything and everything that ever existed, fully freezing them in time abnd space. It is as old as time itself and it grows larger as it feeds. However, since the beginning of the Bleach, there has been a multidimesnonal race known D'esprit has been the Guardians Of Color in the multiverse. D'esprit has defeated and sealed the Bleach away countless times and its now up to Acri'lyque - the current holder of the legendary Pinceau Chromatique and heir to the royal throne - to once again destroy the Bleach and preserve the soul of multiverse, as it has been for countless eons.
-Characters: You are Acri'lyque, a multidimensional Guardian Of Color destined to prevent the sentient calamity known as the Bleach from draining the multiverse of its color. Acri is the current holder of the legendary Pinceau Chromatique, an ancient weapon of good and the only thing that can damage the Bleach. She is also the single heir to the royal throne and by default the future ruler of Esprit, her home dimension. Despite usually being quite shy and soft spoken, she has an unstoppable determination that never falters at any challenge. She looks up to and wants to follow in the footsteps of her father, King Turqoi'lyque, and feels a little anxious about disappointing him in her first "Bleach Mission". Speaking of the Bleach, its a white, formless, immortal and semi-sentient blob-like entity who resurrects every couple billion years, after being sealed away by the current holder of the Pineau Chromatique from the House Of 'Lyque. It doesn't really have goals or dreams and so isn' malevolent it just does the only thing it knows, which is to feed. Most of the time it aimlessly wanders, slowly, almost as if in a dream-like state. However, it can recognize any D'esprit and will viciously and mercilessly attack them, as it feels incomprehensible amount of hatred towards them after being hurt by them countless times.
World: The game takes place in an unnamed dimension, on an unknown planet
Atmosphere: Lonely, melancholic, gets more hopeful bit by bit as the colors return.
